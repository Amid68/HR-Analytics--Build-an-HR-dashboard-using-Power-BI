## HR Analytics Dashboard with Power BI

In this guided project, I ventured into using Microsoft Power BI for the first time, building on my previous knowledge in data visualization. The project focused on creating two main pages: an "Employee Demographics" page to visualize the overall demographic outlook of an organization, and an "Employee Detail" page to provide detailed information about individual employees. Key skills gained include:

- **Data Import and Transformation:** Learned how to import HR data from a CSV file into Power BI and use the Power Query Editor to clean and manipulate the data.
- **Creating Visualizations:** Developed skills in creating various visualizations such as pie charts, doughnut charts, and card visuals to represent gender diversity, racial diversity, and other employee demographics.
- **Interactive Dashboard Features:** Added interactive elements like slicers and buttons to make the dashboard user-friendly, allowing for easy filtering by department and detailed employee views.
- **Design and Customization:** Customized the dashboard using themes, background images, and formatting options to create a visually appealing and functional HR analytics tool.

By the end of this project, I gained confidence in using Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards for HR analytics, marking my first successful experience with this powerful tool.
